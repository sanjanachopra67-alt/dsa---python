# LeetCode 1: Two Sum
# Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums, target):
        seen = {}
        for i, num in enumerate(nums):
            diff = target - num
            if diff in seen:
                return [seen[diff], i]
            seen[num] = i

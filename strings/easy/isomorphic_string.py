"""The Isomorphic Strings problem asks us to determine if two strings s and t are isomorphic.

Two strings are isomorphic if the characters in one string can be replaced to get the other string, while maintaining the following conditions:

Each character in s must map to exactly one character in t.
No two characters in s can map to the same character in t.
The mapping must be consistent across the entire string."""
